# Shell Script for Website Backup

## Overview:
This script automates the backup process for a website, including its MySQL database. It creates a compressed tar archive containing virtual host configurations, website files, and a MySQL database dump.

## Variables:

## Database Export:
```bash
mysqldump -u $db_login -p$db_pwd $db_name > dbbackupfile
```

Exports the MySQL database specified by $db_login, $db_pwd, and $db_name to a file named "dbbackupfile".
Create Archive:

```bash

tar -czf $backup_file $vhost $website_files dbbackupfile
```

Creates a compressed tar archive named by $backup_file. Includes virtual host configurations, website files, and the exported database file.
Clean Database Export:

```bash

rm dbbackupfile
```
Removes the temporary database backup file.

Note: The comment at the end, # for back up in windows, appears incomplete and may be a note about backup compatibility with Windows.

Please ensure variable names are used with the correct syntax in the tar command (e.g., $backup_file, $vhost, $website_files), and update mysqldump to use the correct syntax for the password (-p$db_pwd).
